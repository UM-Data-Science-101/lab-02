# Data Science 101: Lab 02
This lab is designed to help you get a feel for the basics of Python programming. You will be working with a Jupyter notebook, which is a tool that allows you to write and run Python code in an interactive way. This lab will cover the following topics:

- Data types
- Variables
- Arithmetic operations
- Functions
- Control structures (if-else statements and loops)
- Lists
- Copilot

## Getting started
1. Click on the green "Code" button in the top right corner of this page and select "Open with Codespaces". This will start a new Codespace with this repository loaded.
2. Once the Codespace is ready, open the `notebooks/lab02_jupyter_python.ipynb` file and follow the instructions in the notebook.
